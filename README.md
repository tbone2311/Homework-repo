# Horiseon Marketing challenge #1

## Description

This project is the refactored version of our first challenge project. I refactored the HTML to have semantic HTML elements and the CSS file to consolidate all of the classes that had the same values, also commented all the CSS file properly. Used git workflow to push and pull project up to github and deployed project. I learned how to use semantic HTML elements in a logical order. I did this to learn how HTML and basic CSS interact with each other.


## Installation

In order to get the development enviorment running you will need to clone the repository from my git hub [link]https://github.com/tbone2311/Homework-repo.git through your terminal, after cloning the repository open open the directory in VS-code.


## Usage

This webpage uses semantic HTML elements, such as header, nav, section, article, and footer, to provide meaning and structure to the content. This helps users  to understand the content and its organization easily. The HTML elements have been designed with a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning, so that users can understand the content even if they disable styling. All image elements in this webpage include alt attributes that provide alternative text to describe the image. The heading attributes have been organized in a sequential order so that users can easily understand the hierarchy of the content and navigate the webpage.
The webpage's title element has been designed to be descriptive,  summarizing the content of the webpage.
